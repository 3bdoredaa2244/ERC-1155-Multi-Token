## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the ERC-1155 standard, a versatile multi-token standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single smart contract. ERC-1155 is efficient in terms of gas costs and ideal for gaming assets, collectibles, and more complex token scenarios.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Token Support**: Manages multiple token types (fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible) in one contract.
- **Efficient Batch Operations**: Reduces gas costs for transferring multiple tokens through batch transfers.
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of use cases, from in-game items to digital collectibles and beyond.

## Background

The ERC-1155 standard allows for a single contract to manage multiple token types, enabling more efficient storage and gas usage. Unlike ERC-20 and ERC-721, ERC-1155 can handle both fungible and non-fungible tokens, making it ideal for scenarios that involve numerous token types, such as gaming items or collectibles.
